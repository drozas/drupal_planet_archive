Drupal Planet Archive
=====================

Retrieve and display links from articles published at Drupal Planet (https://www.drupal.org/planet). Running instance available at: http://www.davidrozas.com/lab/drupal_planet_archive.php

This archive has been designed for researching purposes for the PhD thesis: "Drupal as Commons-Based Peer Production community: an ethnographic perspective" (http://www.surrey.ac.uk/sociology/people/phd/david_rozas/index.htm). SOME OF THE POSTS WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED IN DRUPAL PLANET DURING THIS PERIOD MIGHT NOT APPEAR IN THIS ARCHIVE.

Two different strategies are employed:
 - A PHP script which periodically includes the new posts from Drupal Planet. This script was first run on 30/12/2014. From that date (including the previous 30 posts), the list should be exhaustive as far as no errors might have provoked the server to go down.
 - A Python script to recover the blog posts fetched via the RSS reader of Thunderbird. The source were a set of .eml files parsed and included into the database. These came from several machines and were merged. However, some of the blog posts might not have been gathered (e.g.: if the e-mail client was not run for a while). Therefore, the list regarding the previous period might not be so exhaustive and some of the posts might have gotten lost. More links (up to March 2013) will be added soon.
 - The source code can be found in GitHub under a GPLv3 license.
